# Hey there :wave:

I'm glad you made it here. Let me introduce myself first:
I am Patrik, Open Source enthusiast and maintainer, student at TU Munich,
and passionate about doing sports [:bicyclist: :swimmer: :runner:](https://www.strava.com/athletes/76301023).

Mostly, I work with GO and TypeScript. Check out my current big project, [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto),
the first Open Source implementation of Google's Zanzibar access control system :tada:

To better manage the current circumstances, I collaborated on a
[GitHub based API for retrieving occupancies](https://github.com/zepatrik/munich-corona-occupancies)
during corona restrictions/lockdown all around Munich.
