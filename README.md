# Hey there :wave:

I'm glad you made it here. Let me introduce myself first:
I am Patrik, Open Source enthusiast and maintainer, student at TU Munich, and passionate about doing sports
:bicyclist: :swimmer: :runner:.

Mostly, I work with Go and TypeScript. I am passionate about security, automata and formal languages, and functional
programming (the most hyped topics, I know :wink:). Check out my current big
project, [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto), the first **Open Source implementation of Google's Zanzibar access
control system** :tada:

To better manage the current circumstances, I co-authored a
[GitHub based API for retrieving occupancies](https://github.com/zepatrik/munich-corona-occupancies)
during corona restrictions/lockdown all around Munich.

Have a look on my pinned repositories for all the projects I did major contributions, or that are important to me.
